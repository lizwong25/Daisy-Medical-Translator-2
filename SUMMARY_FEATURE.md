# After-Visit Summary Feature

## Overview
The Daisy Medical Translator now includes an automatic after-visit summary generation feature that creates structured medical summaries in the target language after transcription is completed.

## How It Works

1. **Recording Phase**: User records their voice in the source language
2. **Transcription Phase**: Audio is transcribed and translated to the target language
3. **Summary Generation**: Automatically generates an after-visit summary in the target language
4. **Display**: Shows the summary with key points and recommendations

## Features

### Automatic Summary Generation
- Triggers automatically when transcription is completed
- Generates summaries in the target language (not source language)
- Includes structured sections: Summary, Key Points, and Recommendations

### Multi-Language Support
- **Spanish (es)**: Generates Spanish summaries with medical terminology
- **French (fr)**: Generates French summaries with medical terminology  
- **English (en)**: Default English summaries for other languages

### Summary Structure
Each summary follows the exact medical format with these sections:
- **After Visit Note**: Header for the medical document
- **Instructions**: Concrete, prescribed actions (tests, medications, follow-ups, emergency care)
- **Medication List**: All current medications with dosage and frequency
- **Patient Summary**: One paragraph with reason for visit, symptoms, onset/duration, and relevant history
- **Recommendations**: Optional lifestyle and self-care advice
- **Standing Order**: Any standing orders with diagnosis, physician name, and date

### User Interface
- Beautiful gradient card design with medical-themed styling
- Loading state with spinner during generation
- Copy functionality for individual sections
- Integrated download feature includes summary in exported files

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created
- `hooks/useSummary.ts` - Summary generation hook
- `SUMMARY_FEATURE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `hooks/useTranscription.ts` - Added summary generation integration
- `components/TranscriptionView.tsx` - Added summary display UI

### Key Components

```typescript
interface SummaryResult {
